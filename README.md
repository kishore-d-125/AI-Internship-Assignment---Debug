# Blood Test Analyzer - AI-Powered Medical Report Analysis

A professional blood test analysis system built with CrewAI that provides comprehensive medical insights, nutritional recommendations, and exercise planning based on blood test reports.

## ✅ **SYSTEM STATUS: FULLY WORKING**

The blood test analyzer is now **completely functional** and ready for production use. All critical bugs have been resolved and the system has been thoroughly tested.

## 🐛 **Bugs Found and Fixed**

### Critical Bugs Fixed:

1. **Missing LLM Configuration** 
   - **Bug**: `llm = llm` in `agents.py` was undefined
   - **Fix**: Added proper OpenAI LLM configuration with environment variable support

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - **Bug**: Missing imports for `PDFLoader`, `langchain_openai`, and other required packages
   - **Fix**: Added all missing dependencies to `requirements.txt` and proper imports

3. **Incorrect Tool Method Definitions**
   - **Bug**: `read_data_tool` was defined as async but called synchronously
   - **Fix**: Corrected method definitions and tool usage patterns

4. **Missing Error Handling**
   - **Bug**: Limited error handling for file uploads and API calls
   - **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling and validation

5. **Incorrect File Path Handling**
   - **Bug**: The `run_crew` function didn't use the provided file_path parameter
   - **Fix**: Updated task descriptions to properly reference file paths

6. **Unprofessional Agent Descriptions**
   - **Bug**: Agents had unprofessional and potentially harmful descriptions
   - **Fix**: Created professional, responsible agent descriptions for medical analysis

7. **Import Errors**
   - **Bug**: Incorrect import statements for CrewAI components
   - **Fix**: Updated all import statements to use correct module paths

8. **Task Configuration Issues**
   - **Bug**: Tasks had invalid tool configurations
   - **Fix**: Removed problematic tool parameters and simplified task definitions
