## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

- **Web search and advanced CrewAI tools are currently disabled** due to the `crewai_tools` dependency not being installed (Windows build issues with `chroma-hnswlib`).
- **Core features (PDF analysis, medical/nutrition/exercise agents) work fully.**
- If you want web search or advanced CrewAI tools, see the troubleshooting section for installation help.

## üêõ Bugs Found and Fixed

### Critical Bugs Fixed:

1. **Missing LLM Configuration** 
   - **Bug**: `llm = llm` in `agents.py` was undefined
   - **Fix**: Added proper OpenAI LLM configuration with environment variable support

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - **Bug**: Missing imports for `PDFLoader`, `langchain_openai`, and other required packages
   - **Fix**: Added all missing dependencies to `requirements.txt` and proper imports

3. **Incorrect Tool Method Definitions**
   - **Bug**: `read_data_tool` was defined as async but called synchronously
   - **Fix**: Changed to synchronous method and added proper error handling

4. **File Path Handling Issues**
   - **Bug**: `run_crew` function ignored the provided `file_path` parameter
   - **Fix**: Updated function to properly use the uploaded file path

5. **Unprofessional Agent Descriptions**
   - **Bug**: Agents had unprofessional, potentially harmful descriptions
   - **Fix**: Rewritten all agents with professional, evidence-based medical expertise

6. **Missing Error Handling**
   - **Bug**: Limited error handling for file operations and API calls
   - **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling and validation

7. **Incorrect Task Configuration**
   - **Bug**: Tasks referenced undefined agents and had unprofessional descriptions

## üÜò Support & Troubleshooting

For issues and questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section below
2. Review the API documentation
3. Open an issue on GitHub

### Common Issues

1. **"OpenAI API key not found"**
   - Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **"PDF reading error"**
   - Verify the PDF file is not corrupted
   - Ensure the file contains readable text (not just images)

3. **"Analysis timeout"**
   - Check your OpenAI API quota
   - Verify internet connectivity

4. **"Import errors"**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
   - Ensure you're using Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12

5. **"Cannot install crewai_tools or chroma-hnswlib"**
   - On Windows, ensure you have [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload
   - Restart your computer after installation
   - Try installing with:
     ```bash
     pip install crewai-tools
     ```
   - If it still fails, core features will work, but web search and advanced tools will be unavailable
